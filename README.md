# firefly
This project will monitor the population of fireflies through a light sensor and sensors to monitor the water quality. The light sensor will measure the absence of light to study how much artificial light will affect the fireflies population. The monitoring of turbidity and pH value will ensure the right environment for the fireflies.

The data is then sent via MQTT to an IOT platform.
